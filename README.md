# Kaggle-Python
## Main Directory
Solutions to each exercise. Please note that these are NOT standalone scripts. They will only work when used inside of the DataCamp tutorial. This is because there are additional steps that are done behind-the-scenes by DC that are not included in the exercises.
## CSV Directory
