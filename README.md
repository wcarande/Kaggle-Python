# Kaggle Python Tutorial
## Boulder Data Science Meetup for June 15, 2015
Description:

Want to get started with Kaggle competitions but don't know where to start? We'll walk you through the DataCamp course "Kaggle Python Tutorial on Machine Learning" to get you started with the Titanic competition. During freeform time, you can look at putting the methods we learn to use on another Kaggle dataset (such as MNIST).

Please bring a laptop. It is recommended that you sign up for DataCamp and Kaggle before attending. Both are free.

About Kaggle: Kaggle is a platform where users or teams can solve competitive data science problems. Some competitions carry a prize for the best-performing solutions. Many users utilize Kaggle for its high volume of datasets and to build a public data science portfolio.

## Main Directory
Solutions to each exercise. Please note that these are NOT standalone scripts. They will only work when used inside of the DataCamp tutorial. This is because there are additional steps that are done behind-the-scenes by DC that are not included in the exercises.
## CSV Directory
CSV files with the model predictions, formatted for submission to Kaggle.
